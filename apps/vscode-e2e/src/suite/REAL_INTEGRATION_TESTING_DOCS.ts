/**
 * REAL INTEGRATION TESTING DOCUMENTATION
 * =====================================
 *
 * This file documents the critical overhaul from "testing theater" to real
 * end-to-end integration tests that catch actual functional failures.
 *
 * CRITICAL PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
 * - 700+ tests with 96% success rate
 * - BUT extension was broken for real users
 * - Heavy mocking masked real integration failures
 * - Tests provided false confidence while system failed
 *
 * REAL INTEGRATION TEST SOLUTION:
 * - conversation-memory-real.test.ts replaces mocked tests
 * - Tests real Qdrant connectivity (catches ECONNREFUSED errors)
 * - Validates complete conversation memory workflows
 * - Tests UI state consistency during real operations
 * - Validates error handling with real failure conditions
 * - Tests search functionality with actual vector operations
 * - Validates settings integration with experimental features

/**
 * CONCLUSION: FROM THEATER TO REALITY
 *
 * The new conversation-memory-real.test.ts replaces "testing theater" with tests that:
 *
 * 1. ✅ Catch the Qdrant "Not Found" errors we manually discovered
 * 2. ✅ Detect UI state bugs like brain icon → lightning bolt issues
 * 3. ✅ Validate real conversation memory workflows end-to-end
 * 4. ✅ Test error conditions with real failure scenarios
 * 5. ✅ Verify settings integration actually controls features
 *
 * These tests fail when the extension is actually broken (not just when mocks are wrong),
 * providing genuine confidence that the conversation memory system works for real users.
 *
 * The goal shifted from achieving coverage statistics to catching user-facing failures.
